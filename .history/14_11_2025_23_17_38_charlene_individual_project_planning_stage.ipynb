    "### Data Source\n",
    "The data was collected by [a research group in Computer Science at UBC](https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/) from [their self-built MineCraft server](https://plaicraft.ai/)about how people play video games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Summary\n",
    "According to the `summary()` output above, the data set `players.csv`contains **196 observations**, where each observation represents a unique player, and **7 variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the 7 variables, 4 of which fall into the `character` type, including `experience`(the players' self-reported experience of the game), `hashedEmail`(a unique identifier for each player), `name`(the players' in-game name), and `gender`(the players' self-reported gender). 2 of the variables fall into the `numeric` type, which includes `played_hours`(the players' total in-game time on this server) and `Age`(the players' self-reported age). Finally, the variable `subscribe`(whether the players are subscribed to the game-related newsletter or not) falls into the `logical` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visible Issues\n",
    "- The `Age` variable is missing 2 out of 196 values (it has 2 NAs), which will need to be handled with code such as `na.rm = TRUE` before calculating and modeling.\n",
    "- All `character` variables will need to be converted to be used correctly in a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invisible Issues\n",
    "- We only have data on 196 players who found and chose to join this research. This does not necessarily give the most accurate general data about *all* players on the server. \n",
    "- The `experience`, `gender`, and `Age` variables were self-reported, which could lead to potential noise."

    "1. Impute the 2 missing `Age` values.\n",
    "2. Convert `experience` and `gender` to numeric indicator variables.\n",
    "3. Standardize all numeric predictors so that they are on a common, fair scale."

Subscribers and non-subscribers both peaked around the `Age` 15-20; however, the amount of subscribers at `Age` = 20-25 is far more than that of non-subscribers. Overall, the plots show a weak relationship between `subscribe` and `Age`."
